# BlackJack-in-C
A small command line game of black jack programmed using C. The code implements the use of arrays for the deck, a bubble sort to assist with shuffling and pointers for pass by reference (among many other things). The game follows the traditional rules of black jack meaning the dealer will stop dealing once their total card value is at least 17.
